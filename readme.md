# Project01: Wordle™-lite
## Introduction
In this project, you are required to work with a partner (and with assistance from course staff as needed) to finish three blocks in an existing program to play Wordle™-lite, a word-guessing game designed for two human players. In the game, the first player (Player 1) will enter a secret code, and the second player (Player 2) will try to guess that code. Player 2 starts with 100 points, and every wrong guess costs them 10 points, but they earn back the number of letters that match perfectly in the same place in both words (in Wordle™ this would be the green letters). This back-and-forth will continue until Player 2 successfully guesses the secret code or the score is not positive, and the game ends. 

Here is an example of the game being played (make sure to resize HISTORY to see it better):

- Program:	Welcome to Wordle™-lite, a word guessing game. 
- Ready player one: enter a secret word...
-   Player 1: love
-   Program:	Ready player two: time to guess the secret word; 
you start with a score of 100 
(wrong guesses cost you 10 but each matched letter earns back 1); 
the game ends when you guess the word or the score gets to 0. 
What is your guess? (hint: it’s a 4-letter word)
-   Player 2: like 		
-   Program: 	Player two: your guess of “like” matched l--e; your score is now 92. 
What is your guess? (hint: it’s a 4 letter word)
-   Player 2: lose 	
-   Program: 	Player two: your guess of “lose” matched lo-e; your score is now 85. 
What is your guess? (hint: it’s a 4 letter word)
-   Player 2: love
-   Program: 	“love” is correct, great job! Final score: 85/100
